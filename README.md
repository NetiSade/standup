# standup

This tiny Flutter app has 2 purposes:
1. Remind you to get up from the chair every X minutes.
2. Practice the development of Flutter tiny applications :)

Just launch the app, set a 'Work time' (default is 45 minutes) - and you're ready to go!
Optional: Set the desired break time and after this time the cycle of work time, break time, etc. will continue until you stop it.
